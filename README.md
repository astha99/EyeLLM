## Project Structure

**src/main:** Includes the source code files for getting hesitation events and generating LLM responses

1. dataWrangling.py - Contains functions that extract valid hesitation events and eye fixations (words, sentences and non-fixated words)
2. similarityScores.py - Contains functions to calculate different similarity scores (Semantic, F1, Jaccard)
3. GPTresponseGenerator.py - Controls LLM settings for GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4.1)
4. responseGenerator.py - Uses Ollama to control response generation settings for Mistral7B and LLaMa3-8B
5. compiled.py - Script to generate and save responses for GPT models
6. nonGPTcompiled.py - Script to generate and save responses for Mistral7B and LLaMa3

**src/post-processing:** Includes scripts to organize and analyze generated responses

1. clean.py: Script to clean the responses generated by LLaMa and Mistral by removing prefixes that are not part of the completion
2. format.py: Script to format output in long format

**stats/:** Includes R script and output for statistical analysis

**analyses/:** Scripts to get basic corpus statistics, confidence intervals and plots

**results/:** 

1. BEA/final/: The final similarity scores for each model, metric and condition
2. FinalResults.xlsx: Consolidated results presented in the paper.
